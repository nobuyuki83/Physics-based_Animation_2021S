## Setting Up

Pleae look at the following document for environment setup, creating branch, and making pull request.

[How to Submit the Assignment](../doc/submit.md)

Additionally, you need the library [DelFEM2](https://github.com/nobuyuki83/delfem2) in `pba-<username>/3rd_party` 

```bash
$ cd pba-<username> # go to the top of local repository
$ git submodule update --init 3rd_party/delfem2
```

(DelFEM2 is a collection of useful C++ codes written by the instructer.)



## Problem1

Run the program and take a screen shot.

## Problem 2

Optimize the deformation enrgy by solving the minimization of the deformation energy one-by-one for each vertex.
