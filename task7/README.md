# Task7: Princepal Axces of a 3D Shape

## Setting Up

Pleae look at the following document for environment setup, creating branch, and making pull request.

[How to Submit the Assignment](../doc/submit.md)

Additionally, you need the library [DelFEM2](https://github.com/nobuyuki83/delfem2) in `pba-<username>/3rd_party` 

```bash
$ cd pba-<username> # go to the top of local repository
$ git submodule update --init 3rd_party/delfem2
```

(DelFEM2 is a collection of useful C++ codes written by the instructer.)



## Problem1
